# FractalScout

For the longest time I wanted to build a "space ship" simulator to fly inside 3D fractals. Inspired by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen (credit must be given where credit is due!) I used a lot of the information I found on his blog and from Fragmentarium.

Latest active release of Fragmentarium:

There's a lot of work to do on this project ... my goal is to get it to a point where it's possible to compare the flexibility of type of fractals that can be created and parametrized to the level of sofistication reached with Fragmentarium ... Using Unity of course. :) 

PS: feel free to use, clone, or modify the code in any way. If anyone would like to contribute I am more than happy to faciliate that!
